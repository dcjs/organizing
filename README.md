# DC JavaScript (DCJS) Meetup Organizing

This repository holds information from the DCJS meetup organizing crew. We'll place information here about our history, structure, plans, policies, and anything else relevant to how we run these events and this community.

## What is DCJS?

The DCJS meetup brings JavaScript developers from around the DC area (including Northern Virginia and Southern Maryland) together to learn, network, and socialize. We hold monthly tech talks on the second Thursday.

You can see all of our events, past and upcoming, on our [meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/DC-JavaScript).

### Code of Conduct

We are currently developing a code of conduct for our members, visitors, volunteers, and organizers to ensure that DCJS is a safe, respectful environment. Stay tuned for more very soon.

### Our Sponsor(s)

Big thanks to our current sponsor: [CoStar Group](http://www.costar.com/)! Our sponsors
