# Organizer Roles

The organizing crew for DCJS has identified a few roles critical to our operation. Right now we split these roles amongst ourselves, which is why we have four. That said, we expect these roles to evolve over time and fit the demands of the community and the availability of the organizing crew.

The role assignments will rotate (about) every quarter to allow people to not burn out in a role.
